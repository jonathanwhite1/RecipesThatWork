Fish Pie

Serves 4

There’s a lot of recipes, this is Nigella Lawson’s. This is fish gently poached in milk, then swathed in a white sauce and topped with mashed potatoes and finished in the oven. These are her fish, but you can use whatever your have. We often add a teaspoon of mustard powder into the sauce. It’s an hour well worth spending.

Ingredients:

* Carrot, 1 medium, peeled and quartered lengthwise
* White wine: 120 ml | 1/2 cup
* Baking potatoes: 900 g | 2 pounds, peeled and in chunks
* Unsalted butter: 113 g | 8 tablespoons (1 stick)&#x20;
* Salt: 2.5 to 5 ml | 1/2 to 1 teaspoon, to taste
* Skinless cod fillets: 225 g | 8 ounces
* Skinless haddock fillets: 225 g | 8 ounces
* Skinless salmon fillets: 225 g | 8 ounces
* Cooked, peeled shrimp: 140 g | 5 ounces
* Light cream: 240 ml | 1 cup
* All-purpose flour: 32 g | 1/4 cup\

* Optional extras
* 1 bouquet garni (bay leaf, fresh thyme, parsley, celery and leek, tied together in cheesecloth)
* Saffron threads steeped in boiling water: 2.5 ml | 1/2 teaspoon
* Pinch of mace
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Freshly grated nutmeg, to taste.

Preparation

* In a deep covered skillet, combine carrot, wine, salt, bouquet garni and ½ cup water. Bring to a boil, turn off heat and set aside.
* Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil, and add potatoes. Cook until soft, and mash (preferably with a potato ricer) with 6 tablespoons butter and the salt. Cover and set aside.
* Heat oven to 375 degrees. Put cod and haddock into skillet with carrot, cover, and bring to a simmer. Poach for 3 minutes. Transfer fish to a plate, and add salmon to skillet. Poach for 3 minutes, and transfer salmon to plate with cod and haddock. Discard carrot and reserve bouquet garni. Strain liquid into a measuring cup, add saffron and add enough cream to make 2 cups liquid.
* Place a saucepan over low heat, and melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Stir in flour and mace. Stir for a few minutes; remove pan from heat. Slowly stir in cream mixture, beating until smooth. Return pan to heat and add reserved bouquet garni. Stir until mixture is thickened, about 5 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste.
* Butter a 9-inch-square baking pan, and distribute cooked fish evenly, breaking into large chunks as necessary. Scatter shrimp evenly in pan. Discard bouquet garni, and pour sauce over all.
* Spread mashed potato evenly over top, covering edges so sauce will not bubble over. Sprinkle nutmeg lightly over top of pie, and place pan on a baking sheet. Bake until filling is hot and potatoes are flecked with gold, 20 to 40 minutes. Serve hot.
