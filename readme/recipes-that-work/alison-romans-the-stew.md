Yield: 4 to 6 servings

Ingredients\
¼ cup olive oil, plus more for serving\
• Garlic cloves: 4 cloves, chopped\
• Yellow onion: approximately 150 g | 5.3 oz (1 large onion), chopped\
• Ginger: 30 g | 1.06 oz (a 2-inch piece), finely chopped\
• Salt and black pepper: to taste\
• Ground turmeric: 7.5 ml | 1.5 tsp, plus more for serving\
• Red-pepper flakes: 5 ml | 1 tsp, plus more for serving\
• Chickpeas: approximately 850 g (from 2 x 15-ounce cans) | 30 oz, drained and rinsed\
• Full-fat coconut milk: approximately 850 g (from 2 x 15-ounce cans) | 30 oz, NOT low-fat\
• Vegetable or chicken stock: 480 ml | 2 cups\
• 1 bunch Swiss chard, kale or collard greens (weight can vary), stems removed, torn into bite-size pieces\
• Optional mint leaves, for serving

Preparation\
Heat ¼ cup oil in a large pot over medium. Add garlic, onion and ginger. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is translucent and starts to brown a little at the edges, 3 to 5 minutes.\
Add 1½/ teaspoons turmeric, 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, and the chickpeas, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, so the chickpeas sizzle and fry a bit in the spices and oil, until they've started to break down and get a little browned and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove about a cup of chickpeas and set aside for garnish.\
Using a wooden spoon or spatula, further crush the remaining chickpeas slightly to release their starchy insides. (This will help thicken the stew.) Add coconut milk and stock, and season with salt and pepper.\
Bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits that have formed on the bottom of the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until stew has thickened, 30 to 35 minutes. (Taste a chickpea or two, not just the liquid, to make sure they have simmered long enough to be as delicious as possible.) If after 30 to 35 minutes, you want the stew a bit thicker, keep simmering until you've reached your desired consistency.\
Add greens and stir, making sure they're submerged in the liquid. Cook until they wilt and soften, 3 to 7 minutes, depending on what you're using. (Swiss chard and spinach will wilt and soften much faster than kale or collard greens.) Season again with salt and pepper.\
Divide among bowls and top with mint, reserved chickpeas, a sprinkle of red-pepper flakes and a good drizzle of olive oil. Eat like this, or with a dollop of yogurt, and pita bread if you want a starch.
