• Aduki (or kidney) beans (1 can): typically around 425 g | 15 oz, drained weight varies\
• Quinoa: 28 g | 1 oz\
• Chipotle paste: 2.5 ml | 1/2 tsp\
• Sweet potato: approximately 140 g | 5 oz (weight may vary depending on the size of the potato)\
• Scallions/spring onions: 1/2 bunch\
• 1 Garlic clove\
• Coconut (or olive) oil: 15 ml | 1 tbsp\
• Smoked paprika: 10 ml | 2 tsp\
• Ground cumin: 10 ml | 2 tsp\
• Ground coriander: 10 ml | 2 tsp\
• Roast red peppers (jar): 113 g | 4 oz\
• One green chili\
Preparation\
Put passata, beans and quinoa into the saucepan and add 130ml of cold water. Add the chipotle paste and cook on moderate heat for 10-15 minutes.\
Scrub and finely dice the sweet potato, slice the spring onions. Put the spring onions and sweet potato into the frying pan with a little coconut oil and fry for 5 minutes. Add smoked paprika and fry for a\
further 3 minutes. Set aside.\
Grate garlic into the tomato-quinoa mixture adding cumin and coriander. Add the sweet potato to the chili and simmer 10 minutes more.\
Drain the red peppers and slice roughly before add them to the\
chili.\
Serve this with finely-chopped fresh coriander and a squeeze of lemon juice.

Notes\
Anna Jones has a fancier preparation: Blend a deseeded green chili and fresh coriander with the oregano, lemon or lime juice, and a tablespoon of olive oil. Add 2 tablespoons of water and a pinch of salt and blitz until smooth. Top the chili with coconut yogurt and this chili drizzle.\
Passata is a tomato base somewhere between blended tomatoes\
and tomato paste. I found if I used a can of whole tomatoes,\
drained the fluid in a sieve, and then blended the remaining\
tomatoes I got something pretty workable. One big can yields 250\
mls.\
Coconut oil is better than olive oil because you can brown and\
crisp the sweet potato without smoking. Other high smoke point\
oils like avocado will do. Olive oil is fine, but you may set off the\
smoke alarm!
