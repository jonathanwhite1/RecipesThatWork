# Potage du Barry (Cauliflower soup)

I thought hard whether to add this simple soup but the value/effort ratio is too compelling not to. This creamy cauliflower and potato soup is a French classic, lifted from Stephane Nguyen’s delightful YouTube channel cheekily called “French Cooking Academy” even though he lives in Australia! Legend has it that King Louis XV’s mistress Madame du Barry loved cauliflower, which spurred this culinary gem, and today any dish called 'Du Barry' on the menu in Parisian eateries features cauliflower. The ratio of cauliflower to potato makes the difference – it’s a chicken soup, with a cauliflower nuance, and potato starchiness. The details really matter including the type of potato, use of white pepper, and good chicken stock quality.\

Ingredients:\
Peel and quarter the potatoes, then add them to a saucepan filled with cold water and a teaspoon of coarse salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes. Once cooked, drain and return the potatoes to the saucepan. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of milk and mash them with a fork. Set aside when ready.\
In parallel cook the cauliflower in another saucepan filled with water, add a tablespoon of coarse salt, and bring it to a boil. Submerge the cauliflower and cook for 18 minutes. Once ready, drain the water and return the cauliflower to the saucepan.\
For the potage, bring 500 ml of the stock to a quick boil in a saucepan. When ready, immediately pour it over the cauliflower and use a stick blender to process the mixture. Add the remaining 100 ml of stock and 150 grams of the potato puree. Process again until smooth.\
Pass the mixture through a sieve into a clean saucepan and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Taste the potage, adjust the seasoning with salt, then add the cream and mix well. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook the potage, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. 5\
When the soup is hot enough, stir in the white pepper. To serve, divide into soup bowls and garnish with parsley and a few pan-fried croutons. You can also decorate the potage with a sprinkle of parboiled small cauliflower florets for added texture.
