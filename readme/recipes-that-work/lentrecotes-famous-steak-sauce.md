METHOD\
In a small saucepan start by cooking shallots in 1/2 of the butter. Cool the shallots till softened but brown. Once cooked add in the rest of the butter, with the anchovies, capers, walnuts, tarragon, chervil, sage, basil and nutmeg.\
Melt the butter down but don’t cook the herbs. Once the butter has melted, blitz the butter mix with a stick blender until very fine mixture is formed.\
In large bowl whisk egg yolk, Worcestershire sauce and mustard together to form the base. While whisking slowly trickle in one third of the the green butter.

Once the herb mayo is made reheating it may split the base mayonaise Heat ⅓ of it in a pan, it will split. Whisk back the remaining 2/3 of the mayo to reform it.
