# Spaghetti Pomodoro

\
On the internet this is always “Marcella Hazan’s Tomato Sauce”, which I resisted making because it seemed too simple to actually be any good. Yet it turned out to be a beautiful complex combination that will surprise you with its sweet, bright, and savory taste and may leave you with what the New Yorker called a “mise en abyme (!) of admiration”.\
Serves 4\
Ingredients:\
• Pasta (spaghetti): 1 lb | 450 grams\
• Whole tomatoes (can or fresh): 28 oz | 800 grams\
• Unsalted butter: 5 tbsp | 70 grams\
• One large onion: 10 oz | 280 grams\
• Parmesan: 1/2 cup | 90 grams.

Preparation\
If using fresh tomatoes, cut a cross in the smooth pole, and\
immerse in boiling water for 30 seconds. The steam generated\
pushes the skin off the flesh, and it comes off easily when cool\
enough to handle. Canned tomatoes are OK, but buy peeled.\
Combine tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in\
a saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt.\
Place over medium heat and bring to a low simmer. Cook,\
uncovered, for about 45 minutes stirring occasionally and mashing\
large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Discard the onion before\
tossing the sauce with pasta. I throw any remaining tomato stems.\
Add pasta to a pan of boiling water and cook until the lower end of\
time range on the package. It should still be too tough to eat\
because it's going to continue cooking in the sauce.\
Scoop out a reserved cup of pasta water, and transfer pasta into\
the sauce. Set cooker to medium-high heat, and add back the most\
of the pasta water. Keep tossing as the liquid evaporates, until it is\
a thickened sauce that clings to past (like glazed vegetables).\
Sprinkle on half the Parmesan cheese, tossing until it has melted\
into the sauce. Add the last pasta water to loosen the sauce if\
necessary. Divide among bowls, top with remaining cheese, and\
serve.\
Notes:\
It's a tasty sauce, so easy to stretch this to six+ with more pasta. You\
can dress it up more with garlic, pepper, chili flakes, basil,\
caramelized onion, etc, but then it's a different dish. Do try this first.\
had a different recipe in this collection until I found this one.\
Wikipedia describes mise en abîme as: "a formal technique of\
placing a copy of an image within itself, often in a way that\
suggests an infinitely recurring sequence". did say it had a more\
complex taste profile than you'd expect!\
This probably works so well because - as Harold McGee writes in\
"On Food & Cooking" - butter cooked very slowly in an aqueous\
medium turns back into ¼ cup of cream. I know, it seems like a lot\
of butter but it's only 2 teaspoons per serving and not at all oily.\
Don't waste the onion! https://bit.ly/39V170x\
The long cooking time is essential, but definitely worth it. And I can't resist adding another ridiculously simple pasta recipe with almost no ingredients - Pasta with Caramelized Onions. It also takes a long time, but the contrast of sweetened onions and salty cheese always delights. https://f52.co/3cQ2rSO.
