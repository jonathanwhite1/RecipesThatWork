# Summer Corn Salad

\
This is from Heidi Swanson’s lovely food blog called 101 Cookbooks, a source of excellent ideas with a strong focus on easy vegetarian dishes. This recipe was a hit from the very first time we tried it. Yes, you do need all the sugar in the dressing. And only fresh oregano, not dried. »\
Serves 4+\
Ingredients:\
• Corn: 6 ears | 900 grams\
• Large shallot, minced: 1 item | 35 grams\
• Fresh lemon juice: 1/3 cup | 75 grams\
• Toasted pepitas: 3/4 cup | 90 grams\
• Sunflower seeds: 3/4 cup | 90 grams\
• Mexican oregano: 1/2 teaspoon | 2 grams\
• Brown sugar: 2 tablespoons | 30 grams\
• Sunflower (neutral) oil: 2 tablespoons | 30 milliliters

Preparation\
Shuck the raw corn and use a knife to cut the kernels from the\
cobs. Place the kernels in a medium bowl with the shallot while you\
make the dressing.\
Combine the lemon juice, salt, and sugar in a small bowl or jar.\
Gradually add the oil, whisking vigorously until the dressing comes\
together. Taste, and adjust with more lemon juice, salt or sugar, if\
needed. This dressing should be on the sweet side, not overly\
tangy.\
Put the seeds in a hot frying pan and keep moving them around\
until they smell almost burnt. Every seed should be a little brown-\
black, but they shouldn't be carbon. The secret is to really toast\
whatever you are using, moving the pan constantly so it all gets a\
little bit burned at the edges. (You can use sunflower seeds, or\
pepitas, or pine nuts.)\
Just before serving, add the seeds to the bowl of corn along with\
2/3 of the dressing. Toss well, really get everything well coated.\
Crush the oregano between your palms and let it shower down on\
to the salad. Toss one more time and serve.
