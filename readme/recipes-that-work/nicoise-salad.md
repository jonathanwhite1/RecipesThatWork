# Nicoise Salad

Here is a riff on a classic French salade niçoise. Traditionalists drape anchovy filets across the finished salad, but here, they're minced and used only in the dressing. Anchovy admirers can certainly add more for garnish — and anchovy avoiders can simply leave them out. The only cooking is boiling the potatoes and haricots verts, which can be done together in the same pot. Add a jammy egg or two if you like. Dressing the vegetables while warm helps them absorb all the good flavors more deeply, making this a salad that manages to be intense and light at the same time.

Serves 4 Ingredients: • 1 large garlic clove, minced • 2 anchovy fillets, chopped • ¼ teaspoon salt, more as needed • 2 tablespoons lemon juice • ¾ teaspoon grated lemon zest • ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard • ⅓ cup olive oil, more as needed

```
•	¼ pound baby red potatoes
•	½ pound haricots verts or green beans
•	1 tablespoon finely chopped basil
•	2 large, ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges, or 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
•	4 hard-boiled eggs (optional)
•	½ cup pitted kalamata olives, sliced.

•	2 (6 or 7-ounce) cans tuna packed in olive oil, drained
•	Flaky sea salt, for serving
•	Torn basil leaves, for serving
```

Preparation

```
•	Make a vinaigrette: This is one way. Most ingredients beyond oil, vinegar, and probably mustard are optional.

•	Cover potatoes in a pot with water, salt, and  bring to a boil. Cook at a boil until fork tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.
•	Use the same water to cook eggs until soft boiled, about 7 minutes. 
•	Steam (or boil) green beans over the water for around 4-5 minutes until they are just edible. They should have some bite to them.
•	Drain potatoes and beans in a bowl and cover them in half the dressing. They can sit like this.
•	When ready to eat, chop the tomatoes, add olives, and anything else you are adding. I often bulk it up with a whole romaine lettuce. Dress the salad with the vinaigrette and put on a plate. Drain the potato and beans and place on top. Add eggs decoratively. 

•	Variant: When I have a large piece of tuna, I will coat it in crushed peppercorns, and fry it two minutes a side. Then plunge into cold water. This can be done in advance. Cut into slices and place over the salad as a “carpaccio” of tuna.
