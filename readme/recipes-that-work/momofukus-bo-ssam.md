Serves 6-10\
7 hours, plus 6+ hours seasoning

Ingredients\
• Whole bone-in pork butt or picnic ham: approximately 3 - 4 kg | 8 to 10 pounds\
• White sugar: 200 g | 1 cup\
• Kosher salt: 273 g | 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon\
• Brown sugar: 100 g | 7 tablespoons

Preparation\
Place the pork in a large, shallow bowl. Mix the white sugar and 1 cup of the salt together in another bowl, then rub the mixture all over the meat. Cover it and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight.\
When you're ready to cook, heat oven to 300. Remove pork from refrigerator, brush any excess sugar mixture off the fat cap and discard any juices. Place the pork in a roasting pan and set in the oven and cook for approximately 6 hours, or until it collapses, yielding easily to the tines of a fork. (After the first hour, you may baste hourly with pan juices.)\
Remove the meat from the oven. It can rest for up to an hour.\
When your accompaniments are prepared and you are ready to serve the food, turn oven to 500. Stir together the remaining tablespoon of salt with the brown sugar. Rub this mixture all over the cooked pork. Place in oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until a dark caramel crust has developed on the meat. Serve hot, with any accompaniments, such as salad.
