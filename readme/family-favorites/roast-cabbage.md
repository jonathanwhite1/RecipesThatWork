# Roast cabbage

\
Yes. Seriously. Just try it\
Serves 3\
Ingredients:\
• One cabbage, Napa or Savoy are best.\
• Mustard vinegrette

Preparation\
Cut the cabbage in half, and then each half into thirds t make a wedge. The base of the cabbage should be intact to hold the leaves together. Drizzle one side with oil and season with salt and pepper. Place it on a metal baking sheet. Pour oil on the upper surface and season. Be generous with the oil.\
Put it in a cold oven. This is important. Turn heat on at 400 degrees and leave for one hour. The cabbage softens during the warm up phase, and caramelizes at full heat.\
Take each wedge out and plate it. Cover with several teaspoons of your favorite vinaigrette. I usually use a mustard vinaigrette made with whole grain mustard. Sprinkle with lemon and parsley to dress it up.\
