For 4 persons

Ingredients\
• Italian durum wheat pasta: 450 g | 1 lb\
• Sheep/goat feta: 200 g | 7 oz\
• Olive oil: 120 ml | 1/2 cup\
• 1/2 red chili pepper\
• Cherry tomatoes: 500 g | 1.1 lb\
• 4 garlic cloves (if you wish)\
• Pepper and salt: to taste\
• A bunch of basil leaves\
Preparation\
Pour some olive on the bottom of the baking dish. Place the whole feta block on top. Chop the red chili pepper and add on top of feta cheese. Pour more olive oil on top. Place the cherry tomatoes on the sides and roll around in oil. Grind some pepper and season with pinch of salt.\
Bake in 400 F / 200 C for 15 minutes in the middle rack. Turn the heat to 440 F / 225 C, move the dish to the upper rack for another 10 minutes.\
Cook the pasta al dente according to cooking instructions. If you used cherry tomatoes with stems, remove them. The stems are there merely for the instagrammable look, so plane cherry tomatoes will do fine.\
Break the feta a bit and mix with tomatoes. Mix the sauce with pasta and add plenty of basil leaves. Garlic goes well with baked feta pasta. To add garlic cut four garlic cloves in half lenghtwise, toss them in same time as the tomatoes and roll in olive oil.
