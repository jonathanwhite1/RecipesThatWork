# Eggplant Lemon Risotto

\
I had to add one risotto dish to the collection, and this one has pretty much been in rotation in our house throughout 2020. This version is from Ottolenghi's book "Plenty", and as expected has a lot of steps some of which can be omitted for weekday meals. Note roasted eggplant can be frozen, so make two or more batches. You'll be coming back for more!.\
Serves 4\
Ingredients:\
• Medium eggplants: 2 Items | 900 grams\
• Arborio rice (uncooked): 7 oz | 200 grams\
• One medium onion: 1 item | 160 grams\
• White wine (optional): 1/2 cup | 120 mls\
• Garlic cloves: 2 Items | 16 grams\
• Stock (chicken or veg.): 4 cups | 1000 mls\
• Lemon: 1 item | 75 grams\
• Parmesan cheese: 3 oz | 85 grams\
• Basil leaves (optional): 1/2 cup | 10 grams.

Preparation\
Pierce one eggplant with a sharp knife in a few places and place it\
in an oven on a foil-lined tray at 400-450°F. The eggplant should\
deflate completely and its skin should break.\
Once the eggplant is ready, remove it from the heat and make a\
long cut through it. Scoop out the soft flesh and discard the skin.\
Chop the flesh finely and set aside.\
Cut the other eggplant into ½-inch dice. Heat up ⅓ cup of olive oil\
in a frying pan and fry the eggplant dice in batches until golden\
and crisp. Transfer to a colander or paper-line plate and sprinkle\
with salt. Leave to cool.\
Put the onion and remaining oil in a heavy pan and fry slowly until\
the onion is soft and translucent. Add garlic and cook for 3 more\
minutes. Turn up the heat and add the rice, stirring to coat it in the\
oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes.\
Add wine and cook until nearly evaporated. Turn the heat down to\
simmer and start add hot stock, a ladle at a time, waiting until each\
has been absorbed before adding the next. Stir often.\
When the rice has become softer and creamy add most of the\
lemon's zest and all its juice, creamy roasted eggplant, and most of\
the parmesan. Salt to taste (½-1 teaspoons). Rest it for 5 minutes.\
Spoon risotto out and sprinkle each serving with diced fried\
eggplant, parmesan, basil, and any remaining lemon zest.

Notes:\
Yotam Ottolenghi always puts the eggplant under a grill and broils\
it turning often. This seems a lot of work for little gain. I usually\
roast these when making another dish - hence the variable\
temperature range - and leave in the fridge to make later.\
Some people do not like the texture of roast eggplant, so always\
squish it to a paste or even blend it in a smoothie maker. And I\
usually make more than needed and freeze the excess so it' always\
30' away from dinner.\
usually use chicken stock for this, but vegetable works just as well.\
Store-bought chicken stock I OK as a stand-in, but the vegetable\
versions are more variable in quality.\
The fried eggplant adds another dimension of taste and texture to\
the dish, but a "weekday version" is great with just the roasted\
flesh. Also, if you don't have wine or basil, they're not essential.
