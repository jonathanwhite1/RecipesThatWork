# Lemon Caper Butter Sauce

Lemon Caper Butter Sauce

Two lemons\
Two tablespoons of very cold butter\
A little herb maybe (Savory) ½ tsp\
A tablespoon of capers, crush half of them.

Take a half a teaspoon of butter in your sauté pan on medium high for about 2 minutes until the foam starts evaporating. Milk slide will caramelize a little bit to give a nutty aroma.

Add Capers and give a 20 second sauté.

Add a couple of ounces of lemon juice from two lemons. Keep the heat medium high and reduce by a third.

Turn off the heat and add the butter, salt and pepper, and keep it moving. The butter is going to cool the sauce, and the fat emulsifies into the lemon juice. If the heat is off and you keep it moving it will form a sauce without separating.
