# Summer Pudding

\
This quintessentially British pud, packed with juicy summer berries, is so much easier than it looks, perfect for beginners. Keep the bread layer thin. It will hold its shape, and there should not be overlapping layers. Any type of summer fruits berries will do, though blackcurrants are really an essential for the right flavor »\
Serves 4\
Ingredients:\
• Strawberries: 250 g | 8.8 oz\
• Blackberries: 500 g | 1.1 lb\
• Raspberries: 500 g | 1.1 lb\
• Caster or confectioners sugar (just not brown): 175 g | 6.2 oz\
• Cheap white bread from a medium-cut loaf: 7 slices

Preparation\
Wash fruit and gently dry. Put sugar and 3 tbsp water into a large pan. Gently heat until sugar dissolves – stir a few times. Bring to a boil for 1 min, then tip in the fruit. Cook for a few mins over a low heat, stirring 2-3 times. The fruit will be softened, mostly intact and surrounded by dark red juice. Put a sieve over a bowl and tip in the fruit and juice.\
Line a basin of around 2-3 pint capacity with cling film as this will help you to turn out the pudding. Let the edges overhang by about 6”.\
Cut the crusts off the bread. Cut 4 pieces of bread in half into 4 triangles but leave one piece whole. Dip the whole piece of bread into the juice for a few secs just to coat. Push this into the bottom of the basin. Now dip the wonky bread triangles one at a time and press around the basin’s sides so that they fit together neatly. Spoon in the softened fruit. Dip more bread triangles in juice and cover the top. Keep leftover juice for later. Bring cling film up and loosely seal. Put a small plate on top and weight down with cans. Chill for 6 hrs or overnight.\
To serve, open out cling film then put a serving plate upside-down on top and flip over. serve with leftover juice, any extra berries and cream. https://bit.ly/3NToL02
