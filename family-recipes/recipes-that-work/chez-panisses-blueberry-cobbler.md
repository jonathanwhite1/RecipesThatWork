# Chez Panisse’s Blueberry Cobbler

\
Recipe from Lindsey Remolif Shere

Serves 4 to 6\
This cobbler, which comes from the kitchens of Chez Panisse, prizes the berries above all, using only ⅓ cup of sugar. The dough rounds for the top are placed so they don’t cover all the berries, and the juice from the berries bubbles up around the dough.

Ingredients:\
• 4½ cups fresh blueberries\
• ⅓ cup sugar\
• 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

```
•	1½ cups all-purpose flour
•	½ teaspoon kosher salt
•	1½ tablespoons sugar
•	2¼ teaspoons baking powder
•	6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into ½inch pieces
•	¾ cup heavy cream, plus additional for serving, if desired

•	Preparation
```

Step 1 Heat the oven to 375 degrees. To prepare the berries, place in a bowl and toss with the sugar and flour. Set aside.\
Step 2 To make the dough, mix the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder in a bowl. Cut in the butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the cream and mix lightly, just until the dry ingredients are moistened.\
Step 3 Put the blueberries in a 1½-quart gratin or baking dish. Make patties out of the dough, 2 to 2½ inches in diameter and ½-inch thick. Arrange them over the top of the berries. Bake until the topping is brown and the juices bubble thickly around it, about 35 to 40 minutes.\
Step 4 Let cool slightly. Serve warm, with cream to pour on top, if desired.
