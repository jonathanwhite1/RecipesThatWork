# Chicken with Lots and Lots of Shallots

This is a classic recipe that David Lebovitz of the NYT promoted. It was made famous by his wife Rishia Zimmern when she typed it out on Twitter in under 140 characters: “Brown 8 thighs, 3 C shallots. Wine, tarragon, Dijon, sim 30 min covered. Remove lid, reduce. Add 2C cut cherry toms." (Do you really need the recipe now?) »\
Serves 4\
Ingredients:\
• Chicken thighs: 8 items | 1200 grams\
• Shallots, peeled: 12-15 items | 300 grams\
• White wine: 2 cups | 450 mls\
• Cherry tomatoes, halved: 2 cups | 300 grams\
• Tarragon: a few sprigs | 2 grams\
• Flour, any type: 2 tbsp | 16 grams\
• Unsalted butter: 2 tbsp | 30 grams\
• Dijon mustard: 2 tbsp | 30 grams.

Preparation\
Rinse chicken thighs in water, and pat them very dry with\
paper towels. Sprinkle over them the flour, salt and pepper.\
Melt the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or skillet set\
over medium-high heat. When the butter foams, cook the\
chicken, in batches if necessary, until well browned and crisp\
on all sides. Set aside.\
Add the whole shallots to the pot and sauté them in the\
butter and chicken fat until they begin to soften and\
caramelize, approximately 10 to 12 minutes.\
Add the wine to deglaze the pot, stir with a large spoon, then\
add the mustard and tarragon, then the chicken thighs. Cover\
the pot, turn the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.\
Remove the lid, and allow the sauce to reduce and thicken,\
15 to 20 minutes.\
Add the cherry tomatoes to the pot, stir lightly to combine\
and serve immediately.
