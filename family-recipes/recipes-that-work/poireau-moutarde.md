# Poireau Moutarde

I’ve eaten this half-a-dozen times at the Brasserie Bellanger on Rue du Faubourg in Paris, trying to decipher how it is made. Finally, on a quiet evening, the chef gave me the recipe.\
Serves 4\
Ingredients:\
• One leek per person\
• Oil, vinegar, whole grain mustard dressing\
• Butter\
• Parely\
• Lemon\
• Walnuts

Preparation

Cut the firm green end of the leeks off, along with the root. Steam them in a pan over boiling salted water for about 15 minutes. They should have virtually no resistance to a sharp knife. Set aside. You can hold here, if you want to cook them in advance. (Steaming is essential - I failed with every other method).\
When ready to serve, put a knob of butter in the pan until is is not, and place leeks gently into the butter with tongs or spatula to keep it whole. Cook until lightly brown, and then turn to do the other side. Meanwhile mix the oil, vinegar, and mustard into a dressing.\
Place on a plate, split the leek with a knife and spoon over a few teaspoons of dressing. Sprinkle with parsley, lemon zest, and chopped walnuts. Serve right away as starter, or with side salad.\
Notes\
A main course variant can be a tart. Steam the leaks as above. Place on a baking sheet olive oil, herbs, and a leak. Smear leek with mustard. Cover with pre-made puff pastry, cut into strips that overlap the leek by a centimeter on each side. Walk with whisked egg. Cook for 15-20’ at 400 degrees until puff pastry is risen and brown. Turn over and serve, like a Tarte Tatin, one per person :
