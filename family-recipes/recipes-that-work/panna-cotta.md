# Panna Cotta

\
The classic Italian panna cotta — cooked cream — is a pure white custard set with gelatin which can be prepared up to 2 days in advance, usually in individual ramekins. In season, it is lovely served with fresh berries, and at other times of year with fruit coulis or bittersweet chocolate. Wait until just before serving to unmold. »\
Serves 4\
Ingredients:\
• Half-and-half: 475 ml | 2 cups\
• Granulated sugar: 50 g | 1/4 cup\
• 2 wide strips lemon peel (from 1 lemon)\
• Fine sea salt: 1.25 ml | 1/4 teaspoon\
• Powdered gelatin: 11.25 ml | 2.25 teaspoons (1 package)\
Preparation\
In a small saucepan, heat the half-and-half over medium-low until it just begins to simmer. Turn off heat. Add sugar, stir to dissolve, then add lemon peel, and salt, and let steep while you prepare the rest of the recipe.\
Meanwhile, put gelatin in a small bowl and add 3 tablespoons cold water. Let dissolve, mashing with a spoon to prevent lumps, about 5 minutes. Add to the half-and-half mixture, and whisk well to incorporate.\
Using a fine-meshed sieve, strain into a measuring cup with a spout. Pour mixture into 4 (4-ounce) ramekins, tea cups or wine glasses. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. (It is a good idea to make the panna cotta several hours ahead or up to 2 days in advance.)\
To serve panna cotta, run a knife around edge of the ramekins, then invert them over a soup plate or dessert dish. Shake gently to unmold. Surround panna cotta with fruit if desired.\
