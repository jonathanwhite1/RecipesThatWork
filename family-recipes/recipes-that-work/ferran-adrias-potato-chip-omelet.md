# Ferran Adrià’s Potato Chip Omelet



Serves 4

The chef of El Bulli, the famous Spanish restaurant, Ferran Adrià created an omelet reminiscent of a Spanish tortilla that comes together in minutes using only eggs, salted potato chips and olive oil. Opt for the best potato chips, the finest olive oil and the freshest eggs. There’s no need to season the dish with salt, since the chips are already salted, but serving the omelet with salt and pepper adds nuance. If you like, add finely sliced chives, a handful of grated Manchego or paprika like a true tortilla Española.\
Ingredients:\
• Large eggs 12\
• Potato chips: 170 g | 6 oz (approximately 6 cups)\
• Olive oil: 30 ml | 2 tablespoons\
• Kosher salt and black pepper, for serving.

Preparation\
Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk vigorously until frothy and lightened in color, about 4 minutes. (If you have a balloon whisk, now is the time to use it: It will aerate better than a standard whisk, and should take half the time and effort. Either way, your arm will burn by the end of this, but a fluffy, puffy omelet will be your reward.)\
Add 1 tablespoon oil to a 10-inch nonstick skillet and heat over medium.\
Add the chips to the eggs. Using a plastic spatula, gently fold a few times to ensure chips are coated. Let the chips soak for 1 minute.\
Pour the mixture into the skillet, using the spatula to spread the potatoes into an even layer, then to loosen the omelet from the sides of the pan.\
After the bottom of the omelet is just about set — it should barely take on color but the top isn’t completely set — 3 to 4 minutes, cover the omelet with an upside-down plate or a large, flat lid. Holding one hand flat against the plate and holding the skillet by its handle, gently flip over the omelet to release it onto the plate.\
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet, then carefully slide the omelet from the plate, uncooked-side-down, into the pan and cook for about 2 minutes. Slide the omelet onto a plate, slice and serve immediately.
