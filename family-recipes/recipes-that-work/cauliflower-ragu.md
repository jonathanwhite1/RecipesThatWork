# Cauliflower Ragu

This doesn’t look super exciting on paper, but Alison Roman’s recipe is always a winner. Cooking the cauliflower in two batches is optional, but adds a touch more texture and flavor. Whatever you do, make sure the first batch is really soft and sauce-like. The usual 2 minute pasta-water reduction is needed to make this feel creamy, but without cream i.e. the pasta soaks up the flavor. »\
Serves 4\
Ingredients:\
• 1 large head cauliflower: approximately 680 grams | 1.5 lbs\
• 3 garlic cloves\
• Dried chili flakes (to taste)\
• Parmigiano-Reggiano: 100 grams | approximately 1 cup when grated\
• White wine (optional)\
• A sprig of rosemary\
• Tubular pasta (Rigatoni): 340 grams | 12 oz\
• Lemon juice: 15 ml | 1 tbsp\
• Unsalted butter: 45 grams | 3 tbsp

Preparation\
Cut the center stem from the cauliflower and cut the head into small florets. Chop the stem into small chunks.\
Heat 1⁄4 cup olive oil, the garlic, and the chile flakes in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium — high heat. Add about two — thirds of the cauliflower florets and chopped stems (you’ll add the last third in a bit ) and the onion. Add the wine, 1 cup of the water, rosemary sprig, 1 teaspoon salt, and several generous twists of black pepper. Tumble everything together.\
Cover the pan and adjust the heat so the mixture simmers nicely. Cook until the cauliflower is fairly tender, about 25 minutes, stirring and smashing with a wooden spoon or spatula a few times as you cook.\
Add the rest of the cauliflower and the remaining 1⁄2 cup water and cook until the second batch of cauliflower is very tender, though it will have more tooth to it than the first batch, which should be quite sloppy by now. This second cooking should take another 20 minutes or so.\
The ragu at this stage should be loose but not watery, so if it seems dry or tight, add a few more spoonfuls of water.\
With a ladle or a measuring cup, scoop out about 1 cup pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta well. Add the pasta to the ragu, along with the lemon juice, butter, and Parmigiano, and fold everything together.\
Taste and adjust with more salt, lemon, black pepper, or cheese, and adjust the texture to make it creamy by adding a splash or two of the reserved pasta water. Serve right away.\
