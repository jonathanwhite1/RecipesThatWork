# Warm Chicken and Red Cabbage Salad

\
This was served to us by a friend at a dinner party, and when I first looked at the meal I didn’t quite appreciate what was in front of me. It was a monster hit, and everyone at dinner including me had seconds. Almost everyone ever since has asked for more, and the whole family has asked to have it made again. It is one of our Elliot’s favorite dishes. »\
Serves 4\
Ingredients:\
• Red cabbage, sliced: 3 cups | 300 grams\
• Chicken breast: 12 oz | 330 grams\
• Small fennel bulb: 1 item | 230 grams\
• Radicchio: 1 item | 150 grams\
• Red onion: 1 item | 170 grams\
• Carrot: 1 item | 60 grams\
• Walnuts: 1/2 cup | 120 grams\
• Pear: 1 item | 200 grams\
• Gorgonzola (or blue cheese): 4 oz | 100 grams\
• Garlic cloves: 2 items | 10 grams\
• Balsamic vinegar: 1/4 cup | 60 milliliters\
• Dijon mustard: 1 tbsp | 16 grams\
• Olive oil: 1/2 cup | 120 milliliters.

Preparation\
Lightly oil a pan and cook the chicken breasts over medium heat\
for about 5-6 minutes each side until it is golden. Tear it into\
shreds. This can be done well in advance.\
Make a vinaigrette: Finely chop the garlic cloves. Then add ¼ cup\
V balsamic vinegar, 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, and olive oil blend\
well, seasoning with some salt and pepper, and set aside.\
Prepare the salad ingredients. Slice the fennel bulb, radicchio, and\
red onion finely. Peel the carrot and slice it into match-sized pieces.\
Peel the pear, core it, and cut it up into around sixteen slices (Slices\
are nicer than chunks). If you have time toast the walnuts; if not no\
worries. Either way chop them up roughly.\
Combine the shredded cabbage, chicken pieces, fennel, radicchio,\
onion, walnuts, carrots, and pear slices in a large bowl. Pour as\
much dressing as you like over the salad to coat it and toss well.\
Working in batches, now sauté the salad mixture in a large frying\
pan over medium heat until it is warm and the cabbage is slightly\
wilted, which takes about 5 minutes.\
Divide salad among the plates, and sprinkle about 1 cup of cheese\
over each plate.\
Notes:\
If you don't have fennel add more radicchio; no radicchio add\
lettuce and more fennel. You can't really get this wrong, but the red\
color and bitterness of the lettuce is nice.\
You can cut down on the oil if you are not wild about dressings-\
about ½ a cup.\
Make double quantities and have it again tomorrow, but don't mix\
the ingredients together until the next day or it goes soggy.
