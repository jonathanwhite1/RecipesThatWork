# Tarte Tatin

Title\
I love Tarte Tatin. It’s one of the few things that will reliably take me to the desert menu at a restaurant. Everyone thinks it’s hard, but with care on timing and the use of puff pastry it’s not one to be afraid of, and it always impresses the guests This recipe is from the chef Susan Spungen, via Smitten Kitchen, but Jamie Oliver has a similar take. »

Serves 4-6\
Ingredients:\
• Lemon (juiced): 1/2 item | 25 mls\
• Unsalted butter, cold: 2 oz | 60 grams\
• Granulated sugar: 3/4 cup | 150 grams\
• Puff pastry (defrosted): 1 sheet | 250 grams\
• Cooking apples: 8 items | 200 grams\
• Cream for serving: variable amount as per taste | 225 mls.

Preparation\
Heat oven to 400°F (205°C).\
Peel apples, cutting off some of the core roughly. Squeeze half a\
lemon over them and coat to stop browning. Have the butter\
ready, very cold.\
Pour sugar into a large skillet, over medium-high heat. Cook\
without stirring until sugar is partially liquefied (4 mins). Whisk\
unmelted sugar into the caramel and reduce heat to low. Cook\
until the sugar is dark amber, 1 to 2 minutes, but it happens\
quickly. Remove from heat, add butter, and whisk to combine. This\
freezes the color.\
Add the apples, and reheat over medium heat. The caramel will\
loosen up. Gently stir to ensure even cooking, until apples soften,\
about 10 minutes. You can now arrange apples iso they'll look nice\
when inverted - in a concentric circle around the outside with\
remaining apples in the center of the. Let this cool for 10 minutes.\
Roll the puff pastry into a circle about one inch larger than the pan.\
Top apples with the pastry, tucking the edges in all around. Cut a\
vent or two in the center, and place in the oven for 25 to 30\
minutes, until pastry is browned.\
Run a butter knife around the edge, and cool at least 30 minutes\
and up to 60 minutes. Then top with a serving plate, and flip the\
pan quickly so the tart drops onto the plate. Serve warm, with\
cream, if desired.\
Notes:\
You need apples that holds their shape.: Pink Lady, Fuji, Gala.\
Fresh is better, not one that's been hanging around for ever getting\
slushy.\
Don't sweat the apple shapes. Halves or quarters are fine. They will\
shrink a lot when they cook anyhow. But lean them onto each other\
a bit, so as it shrinks, they're still snugged together.\
Almost every apple tarte tatin recipe, tells you to flip it too\
soon. Give it time for the juices to thicken up a bit, a minimum of\
30 minutes and up to 60, or the caramel will run off and puddle.\
The only thing you can get wrong is burning the sugar, and you'll\
know when this happens by the awful smell. Just watch it like a\
hawk for the two minutes you're cooking. It happens in 20\
seconds. If you do burn it, chill and just start again: it was just a cup\
of sugar. \
